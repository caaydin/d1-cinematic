# D1: Cinematic

Key requirements for this assignment:
- **3+ scenes**: I created 4 separate scene classes (Studio, Loading, Menu, and Credits).
- **2+ audio assets**: There are 2 audio assets, a bounce sound effect for the loading screen and music for the menu. These were created from assets found on Freesound (credited to Jofae and davo32 respectively). I edited them using Audacity to be higher pitched and also sped up the music.
- **2+ image assets**: There are a total of 5 images (all with transparent backgrounds). These were drawn by me using Clip Studio Paint and Aseprite.
- **2+ geometric shapes**: The menu screen has 2 circles and 2 squares that were created in-engine. 
- **1+ logotype**: The logo in the first scene, and possibly also the loading text and menu title.
- **1+ multi-line text**: I made the credits page as multi-line text.
- **1+ fading animation**: There are fade-in transitions in the Loading and Menu scenes and fade-out in Studio and Loading.
- **1+ object motion animation**: I used tweens to slide in the logo image and menu options and to drop down the carrots in the loading screen.
